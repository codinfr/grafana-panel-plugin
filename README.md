# Grafana Panel Plugin – Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project is a **beginner-level Grafana panel plugin** developed as part of guided learning
and coursework. The goal was to understand **dashboard visualizations**, **frontend plugin
architecture**, and **observability tools** in real-world systems.

Grafana is widely used in **cloud and infrastructure environments** for monitoring and
visualizing system metrics, which made this project especially valuable for learning purposes.

## Technologies Used
- Grafana
- TypeScript
- React
- HTML / CSS
- Node.js
- Docker (for local Grafana environment)

## What I Worked On
- Explored the **Grafana panel plugin architecture**
- Developed and modified a **custom panel plugin** using React and TypeScript
- Ran the plugin inside a **Docker-based Grafana environment**
- Learned how frontend plugins interact with dashboards and data sources
- Built and tested the plugin using development and build workflows

## Learning Focus
- Understanding **observability and monitoring concepts**
- Working with **TypeScript and React** in a real-world plugin structure
- Gaining exposure to **cloud-related tooling** commonly used in infrastructure monitoring
- Learning how dashboards visualize and present system data

## Notes
This is a **learning-focused project** built with guidance.
The primary objective was to gain hands-on exposure to Grafana, plugin development,
and cloud-relevant monitoring tools rather than to create a production-ready plugin.

## About Grafana Panel Plugins
Panel plugins allow you to add new types of visualizations to Grafana dashboards,
such as maps, charts, lists, and custom UI components.

They are commonly used to visualize data returned by data source queries and are a
core part of Grafana’s extensibility model.
